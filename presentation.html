<h1>My experience</h1>
</section><section>

<h2>I met young, smart developers recently, but they are doing everything wrong</h2>
</section><section>
<h2>No one ever <strong>told</strong> them better</h2>
</section><section>
<h2>No one ever <strong>shown</strong> them better</h2>
</section><section>
<h2>I&rsquo;m currently coaching teams in Agile yet I never followed any Agile course</h2>
</section><section>
<h2>I worked <strong>with people</strong> practicing Agile</h2>
</section><section>
<h2>We started 8th color as a Ruby company two years ago, and none of us has ever used Ruby</h2>
</section><section>
<h2>We learned Ruby by building Sybil <strong>together</strong> with Christophe</h2>
</section><section>
<h2>I hired junior developers with no experience at all</h2>
<h3>Despire having done CS courses, they were unable to do the simplest tasks</h3>
</section><section>
<h2>They learned <strong>by working with our team</strong>
</h2>
</section><section>
<h1>Why</h1>
</section><section>
<h2>Sparring partner</h2> 
<h3>Bounce your ideas</h3>
</section><section>
<h2>Code reviews</h2>
</section><section>
<h2>Pair programming</h2>
</section><section>
<h1>Who</h1>
</section><section>
<h2>Someone who can read and write some Ruby</h2>
</section><section>
<h2>Someone who want to work with you</h2>
</section><section>
<h2>Level is not important, <strong>willingness</strong> is</h2>
</section><section>
<h2>In learning, questions are as valuable as answers</h2>
<h3>You&rsquo;ll probably look for answers on stackoverflow anyway</h3>
</section><section>
<h1>Action</h1>
</section><section>
<h2>Find an internship</h2>
</section><section>
<h2>Find a job</h2>
</section><section>
<h2>Start a project with a friend</h2>
</section><section>
<h1>Final words</h1>
</section><section>
<h2>The only required step is to start</h2>
</section><section>
<h1>Happy (social) coding!</h1></section>
