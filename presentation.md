# My experience

---

## I graduated in economy, with my most advanced IT course being on Excel

### yet I've done all my career in programming

---

## I started as a junior inside a programming team, and learned the craft **with them**

---

## I met young, smart developers recently

### but they are doing everything wrong

---

## No one ever **told** them better

---

## No one ever **showed** them better

---

## I'm currently coaching teams in Agile 

### yet I never followed any Agile course

---

## I worked **with people** practicing Agile

---

## We started 8th color as a Ruby company two years ago

### and none of us has ever used Ruby

---

## We learned Ruby by building Sybil **together** with Christophe

---

## I hired junior developers with no experience at all

### Despite having done CS courses, they were unable to do the simplest tasks

---

## They learned **by working with our team**

---

# Why

---

## Sparring partner
 
### Bounce your ideas

---

## Code reviews

---

## Design sessions

---

## Pair programming

---

# Who

---

## Someone who can read and write some Ruby

---

## Someone who wants to work with you

---

## Level is not important, **willingness** is

---

## In learning, questions are as valuable as answers

### You'll probably look for answers on stackoverflow anyway

---

# Action

---

## Find an internship

---

## Find a job

---

## Start a project with a friend

---

# Final words

---

## The only required step is to start

---

# Happy (social) coding!
